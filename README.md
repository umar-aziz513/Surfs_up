*Overview*

The main goal of this analysis was to determine any changes in the weather patterns throughout the year by analysing the data for the months of June and December.  Based on this analysis, we would make our decision of whether to reduce the investment near the end of the year or not.

*Results*

•       The data indicates that the overall difference between the average temperature for the months of December and June is only 3 degrees which is not a significant drop in temperature

        o	So, it seems like we can continue to expect customers coming in even in the month of December

•	Also, the difference between the maximum temperatures reached between the 2 months is only 2 degrees, which is a very tiny amount 

        o	It shows that temperature does get as hot in December as it does in the month of June
